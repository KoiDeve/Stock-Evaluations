# Stock-Evaluations

This project was created as an insight into data analytics, and how information can be used to grasp a better understanding of how operations are conducted. In this project, we will be exploring various technology stocks and how they are currently performing in the market. I have created several graphs to clarify how these current stocks are performing, and will include the source code in the repo as well.

The data was provided by using an API to get information from Yahoo Finance during the time this analysis was conducted.

### (This evaluation was conducted for the time frame of 6/1/2022 - 12/1/2022).

To start off, I created a visualization for how my selected tech stocks were performing over the last six months. For clarity, here is a key to identify the stocks:

MSFT: Microsoft
<br>AMZN: Amazon
<br>AAPL: Apple
<br>GOOG: Google
<br>META: Facebook (now known as Meta Platforms).

<br>As we can see, most of the stocks in the portfolio have lost value over the last six months, with the only exception being Apple (AAPL). There is a noticable drop in the value of the Meta stock as well, which can be noticed around the month of November 2022 (2022 - 11).</br>

This significant dip in value can also be noticed in the rate of return, which provides an insight for the daily returns of the stocks listed below.

<br>As we can see, the majority of the stocks follow a similar return pattern, with a few exceptions such as the significant dip in value for the Meta stock. Individual returns can be seen below as well:</br>

<br>As for the average return of these stocks over time, I have created a daily anticipated return based on the average returns of the various stocks over the past six months. Here is what one can expect if the market follows the current trend:</br>

<br>In addition, I have conducted an analysis on the volatility of the stock by using the standard deviation. The higher the standard deviation, the more one can expect the stock to change at a faster pace. This means that there could be higher risk/reward gains or losses on the stock. As of right now, Meta experiences the most volatility.</br>

<br>Finally, I have also created a correlation table, which indicates how stocks move in a similar pattern in the market. Normally, it is advised to have stocks that do not correlate with each other to reduce the risk for investment. The lower the value in the table, the better it would be to include the pair because it indicates less correlation. In this case, I have programmed the table to display the best matches in a dark pink color. The best stocks with the least correlation in this case would be META and AAPL.</br>

<br>You have made it to the end of my evaluation! Thank you for taking the time to read about this project, and I hope you learned something new out of it!</br>
